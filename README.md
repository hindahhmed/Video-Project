###PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Our project consists on a video about “How to…NYUAD” which implies to how to survive at NYU Abu Dhabi. There are three steps involved: “Eat, Sleep, and Graduate” but all of them with some twists, so it’s not just some regular steps but the viewer gets some humor out of it.

D2: We showed how we have our meals at NYUAD. In the first scene Javeria walks to D2 to have breakfast and she grabs her meal by paying with 3 mealswipes(which is a lot). Our idea is to show how students spend all the mealswipes on the first few days of the week, and then at the weekend they don’t have any mealswipes left :) To present it sarcastically in our video Javeria is sitting outside D2 holding a poster which says “GoFundme” to borrow mealswipes from others. At the end of the scene we see Hind approaching her and offering her to have lunch with her - which was our intended “happy ending” here.

Gym and Library: On the second scene we showed how to managetime for working out and studying in the university. Here Liza is shown in the gym first burning up her calories, and then she gets coffee(A LOT OF IT) and goes to the study room in library. She’s seen to be working on her assignments and having uncountable cups of coffee. She even passes out on her laptop at one point. The screen cuts to black and it’s seen that it’s 6 am in the morning and she’s still working. Hind comes and asks her why she’s up, and she answers that she don’t even remember when did she sleep last time. This part is to show how hard it is for the students during finals to stay up sane :) 

Raya’s room: At the last scene, Raya is seen to be in an online class in Zoom, but she’s on her phone and not paying attention to the class. But when the Professor says thank you to the class she unmutes herself and says thanks to the Professor - just to make everyone feel that she was present in the class all this time. Then she gets an alarm notification that it’s the registration time and she panics and logs onto Albert. But she finds out all the IM classes are closed already :) She becomes disappointed and goes back to sleep again (actually, this is the story of every IM major here because we don’t get courses :))) 

When the user enters the website, they are presented with an opening page where the user could scroll down and the steps of “How to survive at NYUAD” pops up with scroll animation. And when you go to “Content” in navigation bar you find our video. The experience we are striving to create is an interactive and fun video webpage, in which the user is able to  ……( DESCRIBE ).

###PROCESS
Our group decided to split the work amongst ourselves. We planned the storyline for our video together. Raya wrote the script for the video. Liza, Hind, Raya, and Javeria took part in acting for the video as well as shooting it with smartphone camera. We shot the video in different locations for example the dining hall, gym, library, and Raya’s room. We set up the background for every scene and we took both wide-shot and close-up clips. We arranged for props to use in every scene 
Liza and Hind edited the video using ( THE NAME OF THE APP AND ANY PROCESS INVOLVED ). Javeria and Hind developed the website with HTML and CSS and added interactivity with Javascript. Raya did the documentation for the README file.

###REFLECTION
Our initial idea was to create a “How to…” video, and we wanted to do something relating to our university. We intended to make it humorous and sarcastic. We wanted to use the digital video camera along with the equipments to film the video, and we had rented them from the Equipment Center. Unfortunately, we weren’t getting the expected lighting, angles, and spanning on it due to our lack of knowledge of using professional camera, and so we decided to film it using smartphone’s camera. The overall execution of shooting and editing the video was almost what we had expected; it conveyed a story with proper cuts and sequencial flow and sat on an interactive page. Watch the video to find out what’s our message to the audience!
