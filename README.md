# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Our project consists on a video about “How to…NYUAD” which implies to how to survive at NYU Abu Dhabi. There are three steps involved: “Eat, Sleep, and Graduate” but all of them with some twists, so it’s not just some regular steps but the user gets some humor out of it. When the user enters the website, they are presented with an opening page……..( INSERT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WEBPAGE ). The experience we are striving to create is an interactive and fun video webpage, in which the user is able to  ……( DESCRIBE ).

#PROCESS

Our group decided to split the work amongst ourselves. We planned the storyline for our video together. Raya wrote the script for the video. Liza, Hind, Raya, and Javeria took part in acting for the video as well as shooting it with smartphone camera. We shot the video in different locations for example the dining hall, gym, library, and Raya’s room.  Liza and Hind edited the video using ( THE NAME OF THE APP AND ANY PROCESS INVOLVED ). Javeria and Hind developed the website with HTML and CSS and  added interactivity with Javascript.

#REFLECTION

Our initial idea was to create a “How to…” video, and we wanted to do something relating to our university. We intended to make it humorous and sarcastic. The overall execution of shooting and editing the video was almost what we had expected; it conveyed a story with proper cuts and sequencial flow and sat on an interactive page. Watch the video to find out what’s our message to the audience!
